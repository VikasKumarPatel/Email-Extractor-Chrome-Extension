# Email Extractor

Email Extractor is a chrome extension that allows you to get all the email addresses from the current active tab of your browser. This can be useful for various purposes, such as:

- Finding potential leads or customers for your business or service
- Collecting feedback or testimonials from your users or clients
- Sending newsletters or updates to your subscribers or followers

## How it works

Email Extractor uses a regular expression to match any text that looks like an email address in the web page content. It then filters out any duplicates and returns a list of unique email addresses.
